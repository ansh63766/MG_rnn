#Music Generator : 

Welcome to the Music Generator project! This project is a part of the MIT Deep Learning Lab and focuses on generating music using deep learning techniques. In this particular implementation, Irish songs have been used as the dataset to train the music generator.

#Project Overview : 

The goal of this project is to leverage deep learning algorithms to create an intelligent system that can generate new musical compositions in the style of Irish songs. The project utilizes techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the patterns and structures present in the Irish music dataset and generate new melodies based on that knowledge.

#Dataset :

The dataset used for this project consists of Irish songs, which were generously provided by MIT. The dataset includes a wide range of traditional Irish tunes and compositions. By using this dataset, the model has learned the characteristic melodies, rhythms, and harmonies found in Irish music.

#Model Architecture :

The music generator employs a deep learning model based on LSTM networks. LSTM networks are a type of RNN that can effectively capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data, making them well-suited for music generation tasks.
The model is trained on the Irish music dataset, and the learned representations are used to generate new melodies. The generator takes a seed input, such as a few musical notes, and uses the LSTM network to generate a sequence of musical notes that form a coherent melody in the style of Irish music.
